						<h1>how it started</h1>
						<hr>
						<p class="welcome two">
							Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived an aspiring tattoo artist named Maya. Maya had a passion for art
							and a deep appreciation for the self-expression that tattoos offered. She dreamed of creating a unique space where
							people could freely express themselves through the art of tattooing. With determination in her heart, Maya embarked
							on a journey to bring her vision to life. </p>

						<p class="welcome two">
							She tirelessly researched and honed her tattooing skills, learning from
							experienced artists and seeking inspiration from various art forms. After years of preparation and saving, Maya
							finally had the means to open her own tattoo salon. She found a charming location in the heart of the cityâ€”a place
							with high ceilings and large windows that allowed natural light to flood the space. </p>

						<p class="welcome two">
							Maya envisioned a salon that exuded creativity, warmth, and professionalism. She carefully designed the interior, blending elements of modern
							aesthetics with comfortable seating areas for clients to relax and discuss their tattoo ideas. Maya was committed
							to creating a safe and welcoming environment for her clients. She handpicked a team of talented and diverse artists
							who shared her passion for tattooing. Each artist brought a unique style and perspective, ensuring that the salon
							could cater to a wide range of tattoo requests and artistic preferences.</p>
